            (also <i>canopy disengangement,<sup>[1]</sup> canopy shyness,<sup>[2]</sup>
            or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup></i> )
            is a feature observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other,
            instead forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> This is most prevalent among trees of the same species, 
            but also occurs between trees of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, 
            and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.<sup>[6]</sup> It has been discussed in scientific 
            literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple 
            mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent evolution.

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during winds. 
            The abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup> If the crowns are artificially 
            prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions 
            conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession 
            forests where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup> According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.
