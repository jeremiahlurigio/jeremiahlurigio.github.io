                <h1>Hello, My name is Jeremiah Lurigio</h1>
                <p>I enjoy playing sports, fishing and video games. It's always been my dream to make art for other people to see. I want my work to be recognized and talked about amongst people. I joined the GDWD program at F.I.R.S.T because they were the best fit for me. They gave me everything I was looking for, which was in-depth learning from professionals in the field.</p>
