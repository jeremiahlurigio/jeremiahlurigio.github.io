                The Last of Us is a 2013 <a href="#">action-adventure game</a> developed by <a href="#">Naughty Dog</a> and published by <a href="#">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>. 
                Players control <a href="#">Joel</a>, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, <a href="#">Ellie</a>, across a <a href="#">post-apocalyptic</a> United States. <i>The Last of Us</i> is played from a <a href="#">third-person perspective</a>.
                Players use firearms and <a href="#">improvised weapons</a> and can use <a href="#">stealth</a> to defend against hostile humans and <a href="#">cannibalistic</a> creatures <a href="#">infected</a> by a mutated fungus. In the <a href="#">online multiplayer</a> mode, up to eight players engage
                in <a href="#">cooperative</a> and competitive gameplay.
            </p>

                In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as a rifle, a shotgun, and a bow, and short-range weapons such as a handgun and a short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats,
                and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies.<a href="#"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as <a href="#">health kits, shivs,</a> and <a href="#">Molotov cocktails</a> can be found or crafted using collected items.
                Attributes such as the <a href="#">health meter</a> and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged by finding edible items or through the use of health kits.<a href="#"><sup>[7]</sup></a>

                The <a href="#">online multiplayer</a> mode, called Factions, allows up to eight players to engage in competitive gameplay in rearranged versions of multiple single-player settings. The game features three multiplayer game types: Supply Raid and Survivors are both team <a href="#">deathmatches</a>,
                with the latter excluding the ability to respawn;<a href="#"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Interrogation features teams investigating the location of the enemy team's <a href="#">lockbox</a>, and the first to capture said lockbox wins.<a href="#"><sup>[13]<sup></sup></a> In every mode, players select a faction—Hunters (a group of hostile survivors) or Fireflies (a revolutionary militia group)—and keep
                their clan alive by collecting supplies during matches. Each match is equal to one day; by surviving twelve "weeks", players have completed a journey and can re-select their Faction.<a href="#"><sup>[14]</sup></a>

                Players earn "parts" by marking or killing enemies, healing or reviving allies, crafting items, and unlocking the enemy lockbox. Parts can be spent mid-match on weapon upgrades and armor, and are converted
                to supplies at the end of the match; additional supplies can be scavenged from enemies' bodies.<a href="#"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Players also earn points as they play, which can be spent on weapons or skills to create custom loadouts.<a href="#"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Players could originally connect the game to their <a href="#">Facebook</a> account, 
                altering clan members' names and faces to match their <a href="#">Facebook friends</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Players have the ability to customize their characters with hats,
                helmets, masks, and emblems.<a href="#"><sup>[17]</sup></a> The multiplayer servers for the PlayStation 3 version of the game were shut down on September 3, 2019.<a href="#"><sup>[18]<sup></sup></a>

            <p id="s3-p1">
                In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant <i>Cordyceps</i> fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures known as the "infected". In the suburbs of <a href="#">Austin, Texas</a>, Joel (<a href="#">Troy Baker</a>)
                flees the chaos with his brother, Tommy (<a href="#">Jeffrey Pierce</a>), and daughter, Sarah (<a href="#">Hana Hayes</a>). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms.

                Twenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection. Survivors live in <a href="#">totalitarian</a> quarantine zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups, leaving buildings and houses deserted. Joel works as a <a href="#">smuggler</a> with his partner,
                Tess (<a href="#">Annie Wersching</a>), in the quarantine zone in the <a href="#">North End</a> of <a href="#">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. They hunt down Robert (<a href="#">Robin Atkin Downes</a>), a <a href="#">black-market</a> dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies,
                a rebel <a href="#">militia</a> opposing the quarantine zone authorities.
