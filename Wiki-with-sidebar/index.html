                The Last of Us is a 2013 <a href="#">action-adventure game</a> developed by <a href="#">Naughty Dog</a> and published by <a href="#">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>. 
                Players control <a href="#">Joel</a>, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, <a href="#">Ellie</a>, across a <a href="#">post-apocalyptic</a> United States. <i>The Last of Us</i> is played from a <a href="#">third-person perspective</a>.
                Players use firearms and <a href="#">improvised weapons</a> and can use <a href="#">stealth</a> to defend against hostile humans and <a href="#">cannibalistic</a> creatures <a href="#">infected</a> by a mutated fungus. In the <a href="#">online multiplayer</a> mode, up to eight players engage
                in <a href="#">cooperative</a> and competitive gameplay.
            </p>
            <p id="s1-p2">
                In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as a rifle, a shotgun, and a bow, and short-range weapons such as a handgun and a short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats,
                and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies.<a href="#"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as <a href="#">health kits, shivs,</a> and <a href="#">Molotov cocktails</a> can be found or crafted using collected items.
                Attributes such as the <a href="#">health meter</a> and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged by finding edible items or through the use of health kits.<a href="#"><sup>[7]</sup></a>

                The <a href="#">online multiplayer</a> mode, called Factions, allows up to eight players to engage in competitive gameplay in rearranged versions of multiple single-player settings. The game features three multiplayer game types: Supply Raid and Survivors are both team <a href="#">deathmatches</a>,
                with the latter excluding the ability to respawn;<a href="#"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Interrogation features teams investigating the location of the enemy team's <a href="#">lockbox</a>, and the first to capture said lockbox wins.<a href="#"><sup>[13]<sup></sup></a> In every mode, players select a faction—Hunters (a group of hostile survivors) or Fireflies (a revolutionary militia group)—and keep
                their clan alive by collecting supplies during matches. Each match is equal to one day; by surviving twelve "weeks", players have completed a journey and can re-select their Faction.<a href="#"><sup>[14]</sup></a>

                Players earn "parts" by marking or killing enemies, healing or reviving allies, crafting items, and unlocking the enemy lockbox. Parts can be spent mid-match on weapon upgrades and armor, and are converted
                to supplies at the end of the match; additional supplies can be scavenged from enemies' bodies.<a href="#"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Players also earn points as they play, which can be spent on weapons or skills to create custom loadouts.<a href="#"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Players could originally connect the game to their <a href="#">Facebook</a> account, 
                altering clan members' names and faces to match their <a href="#">Facebook friends</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Players have the ability to customize their characters with hats,
                helmets, masks, and emblems.<a href="#"><sup>[17]</sup></a> The multiplayer servers for the PlayStation 3 version of the game were shut down on September 3, 2019.<a href="#"><sup>[18]<sup></sup></a>

            <p id="s3-p1">
                In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant <i>Cordyceps</i> fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures known as the "infected". In the suburbs of <a href="#">Austin, Texas</a>, Joel (<a href="#">Troy Baker</a>)
                flees the chaos with his brother, Tommy (<a href="#">Jeffrey Pierce</a>), and daughter, Sarah (<a href="#">Hana Hayes</a>). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms.

                Twenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection. Survivors live in <a href="#">totalitarian</a> quarantine zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups, leaving buildings and houses deserted. Joel works as a <a href="#">smuggler</a> with his partner,
                Tess (<a href="#">Annie Wersching</a>), in the quarantine zone in the <a href="#">North End</a> of <a href="#">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. They hunt down Robert (<a href="#">Robin Atkin Downes</a>), a <a href="#">black-market</a> dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies,
                a rebel <a href="#">militia</a> opposing the quarantine zone authorities.

                While at university, Druckmann had an idea to merge the gameplay of <a href="#"><i>Ico</i></a> (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of <a href="#">George A. Romero's <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> (1968)</a>, with a lead character similar to <a href="#">John Hartigan</a> from <a href="#">Sin City</a> (1991–2000). The lead character,
                a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us.<a href="#"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Druckmann views The Last of Us as a coming-of-age story,
                in which Ellie adapts to survival after spending time with Joel, as well as an exploration of how willing a father is to save his child.<a href="#"><sup>[22]</sup></a>

            <br>
            <p>
                A major motif of the game is that "life goes on";<a href="#"><sup>[23]</sup></a> this is presented in a scene in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes,
                which concept artist John Sweeney explained was designed to "reignite [Ellie's] lust for life" after her suffering following her encounter with David.<a href="#">[24]</a>
                The infected, a core concept of the game, were inspired by a segment of the <a href="#">BBC</a> nature documentary <a href="#">Planet Earth</a> (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi.<a href="#">[22]</a> Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing them to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the concept of the fungus evolving and infecting humans,[b] as well as the direct results of an outbreak of this infection.<a href="#">[22]</a>

                and the documentary Grounded: Making The Last of Us;<a href="#"><sup>[49]</sup></a> the documentary was released online in February 2014.[50] Two DLC packs were included with some of the game's special editions and were available upon release. 
                The Sights and Sounds Pack included the soundtrack, a dynamic theme for the PlayStation 3 <a href="#">home screen</a>, and two <a href="#">avatars</a>. The Survival Pack featured bonus skins for the player following the completion of the campaign, and in-game money, as well as bonus experience points
                and early access to customizable items for the game's multiplayer.<a href="#"><sup>[51]</sup></a> Abandoned Territories Map Pack, released on October 15, 2013, added four new multiplayer maps, based on locations in the game's story.<a href="#"><sup>[52]</sup></a> Nightmare Bundle, released on November 5, 2013, added a collection of ten head items, nine of which are available to purchase separately.

                <a href="#"><i>The Last of Us: Left Behind</i></a> adds a single-player campaign that features two storylines—one set after the prologue of The Last of Us and one before the Winter chapter<a href="#"><sup>[54]</sup></a>
                —following Ellie and her friend Riley. It was released on February 14, 2014, as DLC<a href="#"><sup>[55]</sup></a> and on May 12, 2015, as a <a href="#">standalone expansion pack</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[56]</sup></a>

                On April 9, 2014, <a href="#">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> announced <i>The Last of Us Remastered</i>, a remastered version of the game for the <a href="#">PlayStation 4</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[60]</sup></a> It was released in July and August 2014.<a href="#"><sup>[a]</sup></a> 
                <i>Remastered</i> uses the <a href="#">DualShock 4</a>'s touchpad to navigate inventory items, and the light bar signals health, scaling from green to orange and red when taking damage. In addition, audio recordings found in the game world can be heard through the 
                controller's speaker; the original version forced players to remain in a menu while the recordings were played.<a href="#"><sup>[64]</sup></a> The game's Photo Mode allows players to capture images of the game by pausing gameplay and adjusting the camera freely.<a href="#"><sup>[65]</sup></a> 
                In the menu, players have the ability to watch all cutscenes with <a href="#">audio commentary</a> featuring Druckmann, Baker, and Johnson.<a href="#"><sup>[66]</sup></a> Remastered features improved graphics and rendering upgrades, including increased <a href="#">draw distance</a>, a higher <a href="#">frame rate</a>, and advanced audio options.<a href="#"><sup>[67]</sup></a> It includes the previously released downloadable content, including Left Behind and some multiplayer maps.<a href="#"><sup>[68]</sup></a> The development team aimed to create a "true" remaster, maintaining the "core experience".<a href="#"><sup>[69]</sup></a>
